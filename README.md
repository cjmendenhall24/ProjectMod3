Title: Password Generator

In this project, I needed to make the app generate a password, with the user getting prompts for length of password, which charcater types, etc.

Using functions, if statements, variables, was how I was able to make it work.

I had trouble figuring out the for loop part. I asked chatGPT for help with that part. It was helpful because now I understand how Math.random gets a random number between 0 and 1, then Math.floor rounds it to a whole number after being muliplied by the length.
